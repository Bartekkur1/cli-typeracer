# CLI-TypeRacer

**CLI-TypeRacer** is a lightweight, terminal-based typing game designed for developers to have fun and compete with friends directly from the command line. Whether you're waiting for your CI pipelines to finish or just looking for a quick break, this project offers a simple and enjoyable way to challenge your typing speed without leaving your terminal.

## üöÄ Features

- **Multiplayer Fun**: Play TypeRacer-style games with friends through a client-server setup, entirely in your terminal.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Easy to install via `curl`, with pre-compiled binaries available for MacOS and Windows systems.
- **Quick and Easy Setup**: No complicated setup. Just download the appropriate version, and you're good to go.
- **Developed in Go**: Built using Go, both the server and client provide a fast and reliable experience.
- **Integration Tests with Bun**: We use Bun for integration tests to ensure seamless performance across systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Usage

<-- TODO -->

Main goal is to publish compiled version as a part of pipeline somewhere and provide users with prepared curls to download it for their OS version.
