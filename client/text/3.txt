The Heisenberg uncertainty principle asserts that position and momentum cannot be simultaneously known with arbitrary precision. Quantum field theory unites quantum mechanics with special relativity, describing particles as excitations in underlying fields. Concepts like virtual particles and quantum tunneling further illustrate the counterintuitive reality of the quantum domain.
