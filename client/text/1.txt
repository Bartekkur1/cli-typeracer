The sun was shining brightly in the blue sky as children ran across the park. The air was warm, and the breeze carried the soft scent of flowers. Birds chirped happily in the trees, and the sound of laughter filled the air. A young boy threw a red ball, and his dog chased after it with excitement. Nearby, a girl was flying a kite, its bright colors dancing in the wind.
